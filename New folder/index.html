    Freedom of Speech & Press: The First Amendment has multiple parts. The first part of the first Amendment is the freedom of speech and press. These rights are together known as free expression. Both of these rights bring responsibility. For freedom of the press you cannot spread false accusations or publish information that may help enemies in war. For freedom of speech, the first amendment allows free speech in public places like streets and parks. However, that power is not unlimited. Speech that endangers the public is strictly prohibited.

    Freedom to Petition the Government & Religion : The declaration of independence noted King George III repeatedly ignored petitions. This time congress didn't want that to happen again, so they made sure people had the right to petition the government, and made sure they responded to them. The First Amendment also states that Congress cannot make a law respecting or establishing a religion as “official”.
